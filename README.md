## Project Summaries

### 1. Circuit Analysis - Series and Parallel Circuits
- The project involved building two circuits, one in series and another in parallel, with voltage sources and resistances. The goal was to analyze the behavior of series and parallel circuits. Key findings include the uniform current flow in series resistors, the equality of potential differences in both resistors to the source's electromotive force, and the demonstration of Ohm's Law validity.

### 2. Kirchhoff's Laws Experimental Demonstration
- The experiment aimed to demonstrate Kirchhoff's laws, essential for theoretically determining currents and voltages in linear circuit elements. Theoretical values were compared with experimental measurements in a circuit with two voltage sources and five resistances. Additionally, the experiment validated Kirchhoff's laws through theoretical application and confirmed calculations with experimental results, showcasing the theorem of superposition's validity.

### 3. Geometrical Optics Analysis - Reflection and Refraction of Light
- This experiment focused on analyzing optical phenomena such as reflection and refraction of light. Utilizing the PhET Interactive Simulations environment, measurements were taken to understand how a light beam behaves when incident on three different prisms. The experiment confirmed the equality of reflection angles to incidence angles, validating the law of light reflection. Furthermore, it verified the law of light refraction (Snell's law) and identified that all three prisms used were made of the same material.
